Readme for Handwritten Digit Recognition Using PyTorch
# Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using PyTorch. It's designed to recognize and classify digits from images. The project is based on the MNIST dataset, a widely used dataset for digit recognition tasks.
# Setup
Before you can run this project, you need to set up your environment:

Python Environment: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

PyTorch Installation: Install PyTorch, a deep learning framework for Python. You can find installation instructions on the official PyTorch website: PyTorch Installation Guide.

Data: Download the MNIST dataset. You can use PyTorch's torchvision.datasets to easily load this dataset.

# Project-structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

main.py: This is the main Python script to train and test the digit recognition model.

model.py: This file contains the definition of the neural network model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

data_loader.py: Defines the data loaders for training and testing.

train.py: Contains the training loop.

test.py: Contains code to evaluate the model on test data.

# Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have set up the environment and have the necessary packages installed.

Run the main.py script to train and test the model. You can customize hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, in this file.

After training, you can use the model to make predictions on new handwritten digits.
